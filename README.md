# FlowChat

A mod totally not inspired by [ChatFlow](https://github.com/Vazkii/ChatFlow). For the Fabric mod loader on Minecraft 1.16.4

Allows replacing of incoming chat messages through RegEx. It also adds toast notifications and automatic response handling.

## Installation

FlowChat requires use of the [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric#using-fabric-api-to-play-with-mods). Install it to your mods folder.

### Where's My Regex?

Usually under `.minecraft/config/flowchat.json`

Example config found [here](https://github.com/bradcarnage/FlowChat/blob/master/example_rules.json). Copy it to `.minecraft/config/flowchat.json` and edit with your favourite text editor and save. Then, "Confirm" in the mod config. If there's something wrong, you won't be able to exit by clicking "Confirm".
